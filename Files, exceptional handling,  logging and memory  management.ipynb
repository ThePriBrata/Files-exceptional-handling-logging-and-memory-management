    "01.What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages ?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Interpreted languages: Executed line by line (e.g., Python). No intermediate file is created. They're slower but easier to debug.\n",
    "    -> Compiled languages: Translated to machine code before execution (e.g., C, Java). Faster but require compilation before running.\n",
    "    \n",
    "02.What is exception handling in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> It is a mechanism to handle runtime errors, ensuring the program doesn't crash and provides meaningful error messages.\n",
    "    \n",
    "03.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling ?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Code inside the finally block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred. It's often used for cleanup tasks (e.g., closing files).\n",
    "    \n",
    "04.What is logging in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Logging allows developers to record events or messages during execution to track bugs, warnings, and other data for debugging or monitoring.\n",

    "05.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
